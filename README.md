Graceful degradation and service workers are related in that they both aim to enhance user experience despite potential issues. Graceful degradation ensures that an application remains functional even if some features or technologies fail or are not supported. Service workers, by caching assets and handling network requests efficiently, help in maintaining the application's functionality and performance during network interruptions or slow connections. Together, they ensure that users have a seamless experience regardless of network conditions or browser capabilities, thus improving the application's resilience and usability.
